1. Explain why these very similar queries get different plans.
The query optimization did analysis for how to find the query with the minimal time. The strategy used for processing
queries depend on selectivity and the output of the query. Since I indexed those 3 element, I can choose to use index, Bitmap Index,
or no index. The cost vary on plans and plans.  

2. Given what you know about the selectivity of the columns, why does each plan make sense?
For the first one, it find 2 rows, which is not 10% of selectivity, so it uses index. 
For the second one, it find 1% of rows, which is not 10% selectivity, so it can use index or bitmap index.
But there are still a lot of rows, so it use bitmap index scan to avoid rereads of the same page and trade random
access for sequential access.
For the third one, The selectivity is over 10%, so it uses sequential scan.
