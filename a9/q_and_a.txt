1) In auto-commit mode (no transaction boundaries), there are bad
balances and bad audits, but nothing else goes wrong. Explain this by
demonstrating the interleaving of the steps of two processes that can
produce a) a bad balance, and b) a bad audit.

a) If several process want to withdraw money concurrently, this will happen even if the withdraw amount is limited. This is because multiple process read the positive balance at the same time and get money concurrently, when they write money back, writing might happen in different time. Like an account have 10$ in balance and process A read 10 and withdraw 8$, B read 10 and withdraw 8$, A write money back of 2, B write back of -6. 
T1         	T2
read 10     
			read 10
withdraw 8
			withdraw 8
write 2
			write -6

b) while some process are withdrawing money, some process are doing audition
T1        	T2
read 10     
			read 10
withdraw 2
			withdraw 2
write 8
Audition:8			
			write 6 


2) With READ COMMITTED isolation, there are bad balances, but nothing
else goes wrong. Explain this, again by showing an interleaving of the
steps of two processes.

Read commited can change the balance when processes are in transaction. 
If we withdraw 8$ from account A and transfer 8$ from account A to account B. Then 
The total operation withdrawed 8$ from audition. Since audition is from another transaction,
The right audition will be culculated.

T1        	T2			 T3
begin 		begin 		 begin	 
read A 10     
			read A 10 	 read B 0
balance A -8				
			balance A -8  
write 2					 balance B +8
			write A -6	 
						 write 	B  8
committed    committed   committed

begin 		begin		 begin						 
Audit: 2    Audit: 2     Audit: 2
committed   committed    committed						 
			 

3) With SERIALIZABLE isolation, the only problem is failed
transfers. (You could conceivably see a failed commit too.) Explain a
failed transfer by showing an interleaving of the steps of two
processes that produces this result.

T1        	T2			 T3
begin
read A 10     
			failed 	 failed
balance -8				
			  
write 2					
committed

begin				
Audit: 2    	     	
committed	 	 
			begin
			Audit: 2 
			committed 
						begin
						Audit: 2
						committed
